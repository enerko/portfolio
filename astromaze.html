        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Skippy the Swimmer was a group project for a course that I took during my 4th year at University of Toronto. 
        As a team lead and a gameplay programmer of the group, I came up with the game idea, took on the central role for the game 
        design, and programmed fundamental parts of the game, including UI, input, art and audio integration.</p>
