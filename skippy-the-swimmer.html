        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            <i>Skippy the Swimmer</i> was a group project I led during my fourth year at the University of Toronto. This is a short adventure
            platformer experience where you play as an axolotl named Skippy trying to escape his fish tank. He must explore his captor’s
            room for small white pearls and give them to a greedy magpie, who will only let Skippy go when he finds all 10 of them. As both the team lead 
            and programmer, I was responsible for developing the game idea, taking a central role in game design, team management, 
            as well as programming elements like UI, level design, and the integration of art and audio. Our distinctive art style, 
            featuring flat colors and cel-shading, contributed to us receiving an honorable mention at Level Up Showcase 2024.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
            As the team lead for a group of 18 members, my primary responsibility was to facilitate seamless communication among 
            programmers, artists, and musicians. I conducted weekly check-ins to monitor progress, discuss tasks, and establish  
            deadlines, ensuring that each group stayed aligned with the project's goals. This role taught me how to effectively 
            orchestrate a team through the entire game development process, from planning to post-launch.

            From the beginning when we were brainstorming ideas and transforming them into a detailed Game Design Document, I collaborated 
            closely with artists to bring the game's world and characters to life. To achieve a whimsical and lighthearted atmosphere, 
            we opted for a cel-shaded, flat-color art style that gave the game a storybook aesthetic. For the environment, we envisioned 
            a fantasy-like forest, featuring trees that resembled cotton candy and plants like gummies. We spent a significant amount of 
            time designing the character of Skippy, ensuring he looked irresistibly adorable, as we believed character design plays a 
            crucial role in attracting players. Additionally, I worked hand-in-hand with musicians to convey the desired mood and atmosphere, 
            making sure the audio seamlessly complemented the game's vibrant and joyful vibe, evoking a sense of adventure with a hint of 
            nostalgia. We drew inspiration from the music of Pokémon and Minecraft, aiming to capture an exciting adventure while maintaining 
            a relaxing undertone.

            Throughout development, we conducted six playtesting sessions, collecting feedback 
            through Google Forms. We used this feedback to gauge our success and continually worked 
            on improving the player experience. For instance, the initial mechanic where Skippy would 
            die and respawn when he ran out of water was found to be too punishing and frustrating for 
            players. In response, we modified it so that Skippy would slow down instead. Additionally, 
            we initially implemented a horizontal stamina bar at the bottom of the screen, but received 
            feedback that it took up too much space and distracted from gameplay. To address this, we 
            redesigned it as a circular stamina bar that follows Skippy, similar to the mechanic in 
            <i>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i>, allowing players to easily monitor stamina while focusing 
            on the character.

            This project taught me valuable lessons about each phase of game development and how to 
            effectively communicate with team members. I also realized the importance of planning 
            out small details and discussing potential limitations of each mechanic early on. Due to 
            time constraints, we didn’t spend enough time planning smaller elements, such as puzzle 
            mechanics and level design, which later contributed to a lack of props and details in the levels. One of 
            the key lessons I learned was the importance of managing project scope. Initially, we aimed 
            to complete three levels: forest, house, and city. However, in the end, we only finished a 
            short forest level and part of the house. Reflecting on this, I realize we could have focused 
            on perfecting one level to deliver a more polished and cohesive experience. Overall, I am extremely grateful 
            to have had the opportunity to lead a team of talented artists, musicians, and programmers, 
            and for the chance to turn a small idea I had into a fully developed game.
