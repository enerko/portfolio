        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Skippy the Swimmer was a group project I led during my fourth year at the University of Toronto. As both the team lead 
            and programmer, I was instrumental in developing the game idea, taking a central role in game design, and 
            programming key components, including UI, level design, and the integration of art and audio. Our distinctive art style, 
            featuring flat colors and cel-shading, contributed to us receiving an honorable mention at Level Up 2024.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
            As the team lead for a group of 18 members, my primary responsibility was to facilitate seamless communication among 
            programmers, artists, and musicians. I conducted weekly check-ins to monitor progress, discuss tasks, and establish  
            deadlines, ensuring that each group stayed aligned with the project's goals. This role taught me how to effectively 
            orchestrate a team through the entire game development process, from planning to post-launch.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Beginning with brainstorming ideas and translating them into a 
            detailed Game Design Document (GDD), I worked closely with artists to bring the game's world and characters to life. To 
            create a whimsical and lighthearted vibe, we chose a cel-shaded, flat color art style, which gave the game a storybook 
            look. I collaborated closely with musicians to convey the desired mood and atmosphere, ensuring the audio seamlessly 
            complemented the game's vibrant and joyful vibe, capturing a sense of adventure with a touch of nostalgia.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In addition to my leadership role, I contributed as a programmer, supporting the team with audio and art implementation, 
            UI, input handling, cutscenes, and level design.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Throughout this project, I not only enhanced my programming skills but also learned how to be actively involved in each 
            phase of the development process. We had the opportunity to showcase this game at Level Up 2024 and the CNE Student Game 
            Showcase 2024, where we interacted with players and received direct feedback. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            One key lesson I learned was the importance of managing the project's scope. Initially, we planned to have three levels: 
            forest, house, and city. In the end, we were only able to finish a short forest level, and one room of the house. Looking 
            back, I realize we could have focused on one level, perfecting a smaller scope to deliver a more polished experience.
