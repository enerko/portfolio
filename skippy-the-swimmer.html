        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            Skippy the Swimmer was a group project I led during my fourth year at the University of Toronto. As both the team lead 
            and programmer, I was instrumental in developing the game idea, taking a central role in game design, and 
            programming key components, including UI, level design, and the integration of art and audio. Our distinctive art style, 
            featuring flat colors and cel-shading, contributed to us receiving an honorable mention at Level Up 2024.

        <h2>What I learned</h2>
        <p>
            As the team lead for a group of 18 members, my primary responsibility was to facilitate seamless communication among 
            programmers, artists, and musicians. I conducted weekly check-ins to monitor progress, discuss tasks, and establish  
            deadlines, ensuring that each group stayed aligned with the project's goals. This role taught me how to effectively 
            orchestrate a team through the entire game development process, from planning to post-launch.

            Beginning with brainstorming ideas and transforming them into a detailed Game Design Document (GDD), I collaborated 
            closely with artists to bring the game's world and characters to life. To achieve a whimsical and lighthearted atmosphere, 
            we opted for a cel-shaded, flat-color art style that gave the game a storybook aesthetic. For the environment, we envisioned 
            a fantasy-like forest, featuring trees that resembled cotton candy and plants like gummies. We spent a significant amount of 
            time designing the character of Skippy, ensuring he looked irresistibly adorable, as we believed character design plays a 
            crucial role in attracting players. Additionally, I worked hand-in-hand with musicians to convey the desired mood and atmosphere, 
            making sure the audio seamlessly complemented the game's vibrant and joyful vibe, evoking a sense of adventure with a hint of 
            nostalgia. We drew inspiration from the music of Pok√©mon and Minecraft, aiming to capture an exciting adventure while maintaining 
            a relaxing undertone.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my leadership role, I contributed as a programmer, supporting the team with audio and art implementation, 
            and took the main role in coding and designing UI, input handling, cutscenes, and level design. 
        </p>

            Throughout this project, I not only enhanced my programming skills but also learned how to be actively involved in each 
            phase of the development process. We had the opportunity to showcase this game at Level Up 2024 and the CNE Student Game 
            Showcase 2024, where we interacted with players. Moreover, we held a few playtesting sessions, where we received direct 
            feedback from players. We used this feedback to measure our success and consistantly worked on improving player experience. 
            For example, although we first had a mechanic where Skippy dies and respawns when he runs out of water, after realizing that
            this made the game frustrating and too punishing, we changed it to Skippy slowing down. Another example is ... (health bar UI 
            or game objective)
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This project really taught me how each phase of game development works, and how to effectively communicate with teammates. 
            I re-realized how important the planning stage is, in deciding as many details, and discussing possible limitations. Since 
            we were rushed by time, we did not spend enough time planning out the small details, such as puzzle elements and level design, 
            which later affected our lack of props. 
            One key lesson I learned was the importance of managing the project's scope. Initially, we planned to have three levels: 
            forest, house, and city. In the end, we were only able to finish a short forest level, and one room of the house. Looking 
            back, I realize we could have focused on one level, perfecting a smaller scope to deliver a more polished experience.
