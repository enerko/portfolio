    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Skippy the Wizard is a game build during the 72 hours long Game Jam, Mini-Jam 150: Magic, which placed 6th out of 129 entries.
        This is a 2D puzzle game, where in each level, Skippy the wizard must use his wand to shoot a light beam to defeat enemies and 
        proceed to the next level, following the game jam theme "Light is the Way". Since Skippy is not able to move, players must solve
        the puzzle to reflect the light beam against a mirror, disco ball, or prisms to make the light beam reach the enemies. </p>
