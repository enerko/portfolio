        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            This 2D Space Game is a game I am currently developing to learn making a game in C++ with SDL. I followed
            Sanjay Madhav's "Game Programming in C++" to learn how to set up the project. To first get used to making a game without an 
            engine, I wanted to start with something simple, and requires no physics. I thought of cloning retro games such as 
            Space Invaders or Asteroids, but wanted to add my own spin to it. I decided to make a 2D side-scroller space game 
            where the player's goal is to dodge any comets, lasers, planets and survive as long as possible. So far, I managed to 
            get the game loop running with a window and a renderer, added a side-scrolling world, input system, bullets, collision 
            system, health system, UI, and a pause screen. Since I have only built games using Unity, this process taught me a lot 
            about how game loops work, how to initialize, setup and load objects, render images, process input, and more processes 
            that are necessary to just make the game work.
